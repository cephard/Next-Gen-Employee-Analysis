# Next-Gen-Employee-Analysis
## Project Background
NextGen Corp. is a growing technology company focused on developing innovative solutions in the software
and hardware spaces. The company prides itself on attracting top talent and maintaining high employee
satisfaction to drive growth. However, there are increasing concerns regarding employee turnover,
performance variability, and salary disparities within departments.

To ensure continued success, NextGen Corp. needs to optimize employee retention, track employee
performance consistently, and maintain fair salary structures across departments. The HR department needs a
data-driven approach to:
- dentify trends and patterns in employee retention and turnover.
- Track and evaluate performance across different departments.
- Assess the relationship between salary and performance to ensure fairness and employee satisfaction.
  
Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- **Employee Retention Analysis** 
- **Performance Analysis** 
- **Salary Analysis**
